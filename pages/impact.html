    <h1>Possible impact</h1>
    <div class="div3">
        <p> It is still difficult to measure the impact in numbers. Since most of the tariffs have been low, due to the
            importance of this sector, the further lowering of such tariffs have little effect. </p>
        <p> A more interesting question is the supposed abolition of nontariff barriers. The monitoring of this process
            is much more difficult comapred to the tariffs</p>
